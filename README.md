# Case-Study

I am Zack Rosenstein - my background is mostly in film work. 

My career goals are to effectively find a niche role in the film industry using the information and skills 
gained through this FinTech course, gain enough financial freedom to fund my own film projects and build 
professional and personal relationships with similar people in my field so that we can be navigators for 
the industry as a whole moving further along in this technical era.

I chose FinTech as a career path because I know that it will give me an edge against my competition, it
will up my value to any company I work for and because I know that moving foreward it will be an 
invaluable skill to have. I truly believe that this industry will effect every other industry like the
snowball effect.
